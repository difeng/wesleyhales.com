## Overview
I came to work at Shape Security exactly one year ago. I jumped at the opportunity to work with [Ariya Hidayat](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/), [Michael Coates](https://twitter.com/_mwc), 
[Sumit Agarwal](http://www.kpcb.com/blog/five-easy-steps-to-secure-your-startup-right-now), and a ridiculous amount of [talented engineers](http://engineering.shapesecurity.com/) and good people. It has truly been an educational experience to jump into a 
small, [well-funded](https://www.shapesecurity.com/investors/) startup and observe how things work.
 
However, this type of education comes at a cost. This post is more of a personal story about what I've learned as a mid-30 year old 
engineer moving out to the Valley and putting all my chips on the table for a startup. It's fun, exciting and incredibly challenging.
<br/>
##You must uproot your family (or life) and move to the Valley
For some people, this might be super easy to do. Maybe you’re young and don’t have any responsibilities. Maybe you’ve moved around your entire life and can deal with uprooting well. Things can be a bit more complex when you have a family and small children. But rest assured, many people out here are doing the same thing and dealing with the same problems. 
 
We’re all paying a price to be educated and move to the next level.
<br/>
##You must be willing to work without a title
Speaking of next level… Do you have a “career” level up plan? From an engineering perspective, maybe you want to become a team lead or work your way up the ladder to middle management. At Shape and many other companies like Twitter, Airbnb, and Google, engineering is a [battlefield of respect](http://www.kpcb.com/blog/how-to-mix-engineering-and-management-at-a-fast-growing-company). 
At Shape, we're all doing cool things and pushing those around us to test their limits - so titles really don’t matter. From individual contributors to VPs to [advisors](https://twitter.com/lpingree/status/555521047127412736), we all code and are in the trenches of open source. 
 
Having the day-to-day ability to learn from people you respect, admire, or just those who aspire to be better is a very rare thing.
<br/>
##You must be willing to work hard
Shape Security is in a unique scenario because this company really does have the opportunity to go from [zero to one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J6YBOFQ?btkr=1). 

In the 80s through early 90s, the firewall "product" was just coming into the market and would soon become the centerpiece of network security. With everyone making their first Internet connections, the threat landscape was just developing. Fast forward to 2015, and you have a very similar scenario but instead of packet level detection, we're doing the detection with JavaScript. We now have a network appliance that is capable of rewriting web content on every request. 

But there are many problems left to solve and there's a lot more work to do.
<br/>
##You must be willing to stay the course
I recently encountered the shiniest object of my career and I turned it down to stay at Shape. You see, if you have a decent side project on [github](https://github.com/onslyde), [align it with the market](http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2014/02/26/A-More-Better-Conference-Experience/), and [push it hard](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/20/reinventing-the-tech-conference-experience/) enough, some large company will shower you with riches to come work for them - it's called an acquihire and it happens all the time in Silicon Valley.
 
Turning down the acquihire was an extremely tough decision. But after I came to the realization that many of the people I work with encounter these types of "shiny objects" much more than I do, it really opened my eyes. At Shape, you're not working with average run of the mill people. Everyone here is at the top of their game. This is not college ball anymore, we are in the majors.
I honestly didn't want to quit what I was working on at Shape, and I think it's the first time I've felt that way about a company <3. It's more than a company, it's the people and the idea that will keep me there for the long term.
